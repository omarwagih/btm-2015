You can add a name for your chunk after the "r" symbol like this. Note: you shouldn't have two chunks with the same name!
```{r chunk_name}
paste("Hello world")
```


You can set figure widths and heights, either together or separately. 
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```

You can also align the figure to the `centre`, `left` or `right`
```{r fig.width=3, fig.align="right"}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```

By default the resolution of your produced image is `75`. You can change this using the `dpi` option. See the difference between both plots below. 
```{r dpi=10, out.width="700px"}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```

```{r dpi=150, out.width="700px"}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```

Figures aren't saved to file by default. To save figures in a chunk to file set the `fig.path` to the directory to save the path. 

```{r figure_chunk, fig.path='chunk_figures/'}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
barplot(1:10, main="My barplot")
```

If you set this to `./` the figures will be saved to the directory containing the `.Rnw` file.

```{r figure_chunk_2, fig.path='./'}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```
